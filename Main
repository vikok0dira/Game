  <p><strong>Can you lead the world toward a greener, fairer future?</strong></p>
  <p>In this game, you step into the shoes of a country, business, or policymaker making choices that shape the future of people, planet, and prosperity. Each of your decisions affects sustainability — but not all choices are equally wise.</p>
  <p>You’ll face 20 short, themed questions, each offering 4 possible strategies. Some look good on paper, some are popular in the news — but only one option truly leads the way toward a just and sustainable world. Each choice earns you between 0 and 5 points.</p>
  <p>There are no wrong questions here — every effort toward sustainability is a step in the right direction. But there is a better way to do it. Each option delivers a different outcome, and your score reflects how sustainable that outcome really is — for people, the planet, and generations to come.</p>
  <p><strong>Your goal: Score as close to 100 points as possible.</strong></p>
  <p>At the end, you’ll receive personalized feedback showing where you nailed it — and where you’ve got room to grow.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Sustainability is more than just planting trees or switching off lights. It’s about systems thinking, long-term planning, and justice. The world needs bold, well-informed leadership — are you ready to take on the challenge?</p>
